# Max and Min in a Unsorted Array
## Data Structure & Time/Space complexity


For this problem we search for every number in the array and check if it is greater o lesser than the current max and min values, the first comparison uses the first element as the max and min value.

The time/space complexity is O(n), we only need to iterate through the entire array once.
