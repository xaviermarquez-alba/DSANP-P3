# Dutch National Flag Problem
## Data Structure & Time/Space complexity

For this problem we need to sort the array in one traverse, the approach used was, start with an empty list and append the 2's to the end of the list, 0's to the start of the list, and keep the mid index to add the next 1 to the last 1 added.

The time complexity is O(n) (we visit the entire array), and the space complexity is O(n) for the input array + 0(n) for the result list
