# Rearrange Array Elements
## Data Structure & Time/Space complexity

For this problem, first, we need to implement a merge sort algorithm to sort the array then with an inverse for loop we construct both numbers alternating the digits.

Time complexity for the merge sort is O(nlog(n)) and for the construct of the numbers is O(n), the total is O(nlog(n))
The space complexity for the input list is O(n)
